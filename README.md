## About the Project

This project is built with **plain PHP**. After spending a long time working with Laravel, I’m revisiting PHP’s **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and **procedural** programming paradigms.

In the near future, I plan to create a simple yet powerful PHP framework and rebuild this project using that framework. Stay tuned for updates, inshallah!

-   **OCR (Optical Character Recognition):** Converts images and PDFs to text.
-   **Multi-format Support:** Handles PDFs, JPG, JPEG, PNG files.
-   **Custom Language Support:** Allows the user to specify the OCR language.
-   **Easy Installation:** Simple setup with just a few commands.
